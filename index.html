<p>Lab manual for the <a href="http://snel.gatech.edu">Systems Neural Engineering Lab</a>.</p>
<h2 id="welcome">Welcome!</h2>
<p>This is the Lab manual for the Systems Neural Engineering Lab at Emory University and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Our research is in the area of systems neuroscience and neuroengineering, and we're part of the GT/Emory Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering, the Emory Department of Neurosurgery, and the Emory Neuromodulation Technology Innovation Center (ENTICe).</p>
<p>If you've just joined the lab - welcome! We're excited to have you as part of the team. You'll find the lab filled with smart, passionate people with broad interests at the intersection of neuroscience, engineering, and computational sciences. We really value diversity and openness in our lab, and hope to make it a friendly and productive environment.</p>
<p>If you are officially joining, take the time to read this manual through, then sign <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RHPqaTXJJmbJIbALJFsgD2QdmmfU_86jgeJuZRB6Kxc">this form</a> saying you've done so (and send to me via email).</p>

<h2 id="general-philosophy">General Philosophy</h2>
<p>The mission of our lab is to produce work that truly advances the fields of neuroengineering and neuroscience, develops novel strategies and devices to treat disorders of the nervous system, and never compromises in quality and scientific integrity.</p>
<p>For new researchers, a helpful thing to keep in mind is that research is fundamentally different from most people's experiences in school. In most undergraduate classes (and many professional training environments), you're usually asked to solve problems with a known solution. You have a syllabus, a textbook, lecture notes, etc., and generally if you use the listed resources and do what you're told, you will succeed. In research, we're ultimately trying to <em>expand the frontiers of human knowledge</em>. Therefore, with research questions, if we (or anyone else) already knew the answer, we would not be studying the question. A great piece that describes this concept is the now classic "<a href="http://jcs.biologists.org/content/121/11/1771">The importance of stupidity in scientific research</a>". One key takeaway: if you're waiting for someone to tell you what to do and how to do it, your project <em>will not move forward</em>. </p>
<p>Here are some keys to being successful in our lab environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Collaboration</strong>: Our lab benefits greatly by being an intellectually diverse team. We bring in expertise from many disciplines, e.g., Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Neuroscience, Biomedical Engineering, Physiology, Physics. No one in the lab (including myself) has the background necessary to tackle all the problems we're trying to solve. Therefore, the only way we can be successful is by fostering an openly collaborative and communicative environment. Ultimately, our group strongly selects for team members who are comfortable admitting what they don't know and learning new material as they go (both through independent research and discussion with colleagues). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Patience</strong>: As mentioned above - if we already knew the answer, we would not be studying the question. Similarly, if the work was easy, usually someone else would've done it already. From that standpoint, we fundamentally expect the things we're trying to fail way more than they will succeed. So while we're always shooting for success, it's important to have thick skin and not get overly frustrated when things aren't working out. Just keep working diligently, keep thinking through the problem, keep discussing it with your colleagues, and continually make honest evaluations on whether a problem is worth pushing on further, or when it's worth cutting our losses and moving on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accept the process</strong>:  Don't hide or be afraid of contradictory results, mistakes, bugs, etc. We're going to make mistakes, and more often than not we'll find results that challenge our hypotheses, or we don't initially know how to explain. So even if something is intimidating or embarassing, the only way forward is to face it head-on and openly, figure out solutions, and move on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Caution</strong>: Science is about being extremely careful and thorough. Double and triple check every result. Be extremely skeptical about results, and think through every way they could be wrong before concluding that they're correct. Ask others to look at your results and think of ways they might be wrong. If we apply extremely high standards internally, then our work will easily pass external review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communication</strong>: Technical skills are important, but equally (if not more important) are communication skills. No one in our lab works in isolation (see first item above!) - at a minimum, you communicate frequently with your PI (me), and likely work closely with other lab members and collaborators. So without sustained effort from everyone to communicate, it's easy for things to go off track, for there to be misunderstandings or duplicated efforts, etc. (See a longer section below on my preferred methods of communication.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feedback</strong>: We want everyone in the lab to be comfortable giving and receiving direct, constructive criticism and feedback. It's extremely challenging to open up your thoughts and ideas to criticism, for fear that people will judge you personally. But if everyone is comfortable giving and receiving feedback that is never personal, it opens us up to different perspectives. Often this will reveal flaws in ideas that are hard to see when you're too close to them, and new solutions. Similarly, it's easy to get too attached to ideas because they're your own - we all have an instinct to go prove our ideas and show how clever we are. In our lab environment, that doesn't impress anyone - there's no "extra credit" for doing things on your own. Being clever is not nearly as highly valued as being able to get the job done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Positivity</strong>: Everyone on our team is working on a challenging set of problems. Being positive and supportive makes the endeavor more enjoyable for everyone. If you run into issues where it's difficult to be positive and supportive with your colleagues, take a break and come talk to me, we'll work something out. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="expectations-and-responsibilities">Expectations and Responsibilities</h2>
<h4 id="all-lab-members-should">All lab members should:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Be driven, focused, and passionate about their work. </li>
<li>Be collegial and supportive of everyone else on the team, and continually strive to maintain a collaborative and welcoming environment.</li>
<li>Exercise independent thinking and judgement.</li>
<li>Take on responsibilities, and reliably fulfill commitments.</li>
<li>Openly communicate your struggles and mistakes.</li>
<li>Openly communicate with me when you have issues with others in the lab. If you're not comfortable communicating your issues with me directly, there are resources in the department (other faculty or staff) who can help.</li>
<li>Maintain the highest standards of moral and ethical conduct and scientific integrity.</li>
<li>Strive to stay current on the latest literature in our field (Twitter is a surprisingly good resource for this - follow scientists whose work is relevant to you).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="principal-investigator">Principal Investigator</h4>
<p>As a mentor, I aim to to ensure that my trainees are working on projects that align with their long-term goals and interests. I will, to the best of my ability, strive to keep roadblocks out of their way so they can focus on producing the highest quality research possible. Of course, one of my key roles is to secure funding so we can keep doing amazing research. I try to stay very closely involved in research projects, but as a project matures, it's often most effective for me to help with higher-level strategizing and decision-making, thinking through results and implications, and work on communication/writing/packaging stories. Above all, my goal is to create an openly collaborative research environment where the research team is happy and productive while doing high-quality science. And as people being to move on from the lab, I'm available to help them navigate their subsequent career choices.</p>

<h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h2>
<h3 id="essential-policies">Essential Policies</h3>
<p>The lab and university are environments that must be free of harrassment and discrimination. All lab members are expected to abide by Emory University's <a href="http://equityandinclusion.emory.edu/discrimination/index.html">policies on discrimination and harrassment</a>, which you must read. Your certification that you've read this lab manual is also affirmation that you will abide by Emory's policies.</p>
<p>We are committed to maintaining an environment that is free of harrassment. If you notice someone being harassed, or are harassed yourself, tell me immediately. If I am the cause of your concern, please reach out to a trusted faculty or staff member in our department.</p>
<h3 id="scientific-integrity-and-research-conduct">Scientific Integrity and Research Conduct</h3>
<p>Our lab is also committed to maintaining the highest standards of scientific integrity and research ethics. One portion of this mindset is that we do not tolerate <a href="http://compliance.emory.edu/research-misconduct/index.html">research misconduct</a>. To summarize that link, research misconduct can consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fabrication</em> - making up data or results, and recording or reporting them.</li>
<li><em>Falsification</em> - manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in records or reports.</li>
<li><em>Plagiarism</em> - appropriating another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit.</li>
</ul>
<p>While research misconduct occurs for various reasons, the pressure to produce results is often a driving factor. If you're feeling this pressure, reach out to me to talk about it. But know that the pressure to produce results is always there, and <em>never</em> excuses fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism. And always remember that the goal of our work is to arrive at new truths, while research misconduct is the antithesis of that goal.</p>
<p>I take a very hard line on research misconduct. If for some reason you are concerned that our work is not maintaining the highest standards of research conduct, please report this to me immediately. And if you are not comfortable discussing with me directly, please reach out to a trusted faculty or staff member that could serve as an intermediary to help resolve these issues, or to the university's <a href="http://compliance.emory.edu/research-misconduct/index.html">Research Integrity Officer</a>.</p>
<h3 id="reproducible-research">Reproducible Research</h3>
<p>This section is currently quoted verbatim from the <a href="https://github.com/alylab/labmanual">Aly lab manual</a>, because I agree with every word they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you gave someone else your raw data, they should be able to reproduce your results exactly. This is critical, because if they can’t reproduce your results, it suggests that one (or both) of you has made errors in the analysis, and the results can’t be trusted. Reproducible research is an essential part of science, and an expectation for all projects in the lab.</p>
<p>For results to be reproducible, the analysis pipeline must be organized and well documented. To meet these goals, you should take extensive notes on each step of your analysis pipeline. This means writing down how you did things every step of the way (and the order that you did things), from any pre-processing of the data, to running models, to statistical tests. It’s also worth mentioning that you should take detailed notes on your experimental design as well. Additionally, your code should also be commented, and commented clearly. We all know what it’s like to sit down, quickly write a bunch of code to run an analysis without taking time to comment it, and then having no idea what we did a few months down the road. Comment your code so that every step is understandable by an outsider. Finally, it is highly encouraged that you use some form of version control (e.g., Git in combination with GitHub) to keep track of what code changes you made and when you made them, as well as sharing code with others.</p>
<p>Reproducibility is related to replicability, which refers to whether your results can be obtained again with a different data set. That is, if someone ran your study again (with a different group of participants), do they get the same results? If someone ran a conceptually similar study, do they get the same results? Science grows and builds on replicable results – one-off findings don’t mean anything. Our goal is to produce research that is both reproducible and replicable."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="animal-research">Animal Research</h3>
<p>Much of our work to understand the brain and to develop new treatments for disorders of the nervous system will involve research with animals. We do this out of necessity, and we hold the welfare of our animal subjects in the highest regard. Accessing and working with laboratory animals requires comprehensive training with our <a href="http://iacuc.emory.edu/">IACUC</a> and registration and orientation with <a href="http://www.dar.emory.edu/">DAR</a>. Further, it requires a commitment to treat all of our animals with the utmost respect, and a responsibility to carefully monitor their health and safety.</p>
<p>You must be on the animal protocol prior to working with animals. Detailed steps are on Slack, and will soon be added to the lab wiki.</p>
<h3 id="authorship-and-acknowledgement">Authorship and Acknowledgement</h3>
<p>In academic research, our primary currency is generally publications in journals and presentations at conferences. A critical aspect of these publications and presentations is appropriately allocating credit in the form of authorship and acknowledgement. Emory's <a href="https://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17540/?security=c5fe9c92049de33a4186c9f0f335e828a88fd662">guidelines on authorship</a> largely follow the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) <a href="http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/">recommendations</a>. As a serious researcher, it is important that you familiarize yourself with these guidelines.</p>
<p>While there are multiple ways of interpreting such guidelines, our lab in general favors inclusivity. We aim to ensure that anyone who has made a substantial intellectual contribution to a piece of work is allowed to participate in its dissemination via papers and presentations. Note that while authorship is a privilege, it also comes with responsibilities, such as helping to draft and revise any communication of the work (including providing critical, intellectual feedback). Anyone listed as an author on a manuscript is certifying that they agree with its content, and is agreeing to be held accountable for their contribution to the content. Contributors who do not meet the criteria for authorship may instead be recognized via acknowledgements.</p>
<p>Because authorship one of the cornerstones of the entire research endeavor, we take it extremely seriously. Here are some helpful guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Generally at the start of a project, the student or post-doc taking on a lead role can expect to be first author of the resulting publication. Generally, you can expect me to be last author. If the project is collaborative and another lab is the primary driver of the project, this may not be the case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once it starts to become clear that a publication or presentation is likely to result from the work, it is important to layout the scope of the publication and proposed authorship. It is rarely too early to begin talking about authorship - this is critical to ensure all authors are on the same page. A key motto I learned from my mentors is to talk about authorship "early and often." This plan (scope, authorship) will evolve over time, but documenting this and maintaining it is critical for setting expectations appropriately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a project evolves, and new researchers contribute, they may be added to the author list as appropriate (this is discussed with all involved parties).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes projects take longer than a person's time in the lab. In this case, projects may be transferred to others, and if so the new researcher may become the main driver (and first author) on the project. This is a conversation between all involved parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the responsibility of the person(s) driving the project (first author(s), and me) to make sure people's contributions are appropriately recognized. Whenever there is any question as to whether someone should be an author, we always err on the side of having a conversation with that person. It is never appropriate to assume someone will simply speak up to "claim" their authorship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also the first author's (or authors') responsibility to ensure all co-authors have the opportunity to read drafts and provide critical feedback before dissemination/submission. For any sort of submission, all co-authors should have seen a draft and had a chance to contribute/comment <em>a minimum of 2 weeks prior</em> to the submission. As an example, if you're planning on submitting an abstract to a conference, everyone that could be considered an author must have seen a complete draft at least 2 weeks prior to the deadline (and any lingering authorship questions must be discussed in detail by that point). In rare cases, it is possible to put together a submission in a shorter timeframe, but only if every co-author is comfortable with the process. If we do not have permission from a co-author prior to submitting something, we simply cannot submit it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h3>
<p>We often collaborate closely with partners external to the lab (within or outside of Emory/GT). Being able to collaborate with world leaders in various fields, who have substantial expertise that is often complimentary to our own, is a tremendous privilege. Two keys to successful collaboration are that we always show respect for our collaborators, and maintain communication so there are no misunderstandings. These are intellectual partnerships, and generally, even if a collaborator's role is primarily experimental design and data collection, their expertise on the project is invaluable. </p>
<h3 id="shared-datasets">Shared Datasets</h3>
<p>Building on the above, we have many projects with great researchers who share data collected in their labs. We do not share data beyond our lab without explicit permission from our collaborator. Datasets are also generally shared for a specific purpose, and any time we plan on using it in a manner that wasn't originally discussed (e.g., to test a different hypothesis), we communicate that with our parters and secure their permission.</p>
<h3 id="photos-videos">Photos &amp; Videos</h3>
<p>We want to create an environment where everyone is comfortable and we respect their privacy. Therefore photos and videos of other lab members can only be taken with their explicit knowledge and consent. Everyone has different degrees of comfort with pictures and videos, and we respect them equally.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is helpful to take pictures that include animals in the lab, e.g. to document procedures, experimental configurations, surgical techniques, etc. People have different levels of comfort with pictures of animals, and there are a lot of sensitivities around animal research. Any pictures of animals in the lab are assumed to be kept 100% internal unless you have explicit permission from me for other uses.</p>
<p>Occasionally you might want use pictures of other lab members in your presentations - check with them to make sure it's appropriate. You might also need a picture of an animal in a presentation - check with me to confirm this is OK. You might want to share pictures of lab members for fun, e.g. on social media. Check with everyone involved to be sure that's OK. As best as I can tell, there's no reason it would be appropriate to share pictures of our lab animals on social media.</p>
<h2 id="lab-resources">Lab Resources</h2>
<p>Most of the resources below require access privileges, so if you don't already have them, ask me.</p>
<h4 id="slack">Slack</h4>
<p><a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> is the communications backbone in our lab. Our workspace is <a href="https://snel.slack.com/">https://snel.slack.com/</a>. </p>
<h4 id="shared-google-calendars">Shared Google Calendars</h4>
<p>We have two primary shared calendars:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>SNEL-shared</em>: for keeping track of general events (lab meetings, talks, conferences, when folks are out of town, etc). </li>
<li><em>SNEL-lab hours</em>: to coordinate day-to-day schedules. Undergrads should list time periods they plan on being in lab every week (either setup recurring events for the semester, or post your hours at least a week in advance). Grad students/technicians/postdocs/staff should list time periods they don't plan on being in lab. This isn't to track "face time", but to make it easier to schedule face-to-face discussions, know when not to bother people on Slack, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have a few specialized or project-specific calendars (surgery, scheduling jobs on the cluster, task management / tracking certain projects, etc).</p>
<h4 id="basecamp">Basecamp</h4>
<p><a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> is really helpful for task management (tracking progress on to-do lists, sharing results for specific tasks).</p>
<h4 id="gitlab">Gitlab</h4>
<p><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a> is a server for hosting git repositories. Note that this is <em>hosted on an internal lab server</em> (not an external website), meaning you have to be on Emory's campus or logged in via the VPN to access it. All code for all systems in the lab is tracked on our Gitlab server.</p>
<h4 id="github">Github</h4>
<p>We have a <a href="https://github.com/snel-repo">Github organization</a> for creating public-facing code repositories.</p>
<h4 id="wiki">Wiki</h4>
<p><em>In progress</em>: we are setting up a lab wiki as a way for everyone in the lab to contribute to more specific documentation of lab practices, technical info, etc.</p>
<h4 id="google-drive">Google Drive</h4>
<p>File sharing, collaborative editing, presentations, and archiving of abstracts/papers/theses/pictures, etc.</p>
<h4 id="listserv">Listserv</h4>
<p>Our Google Groups listserv is often a quick way to disseminate email announcements from other sources.</p>
<h4 id="computing-resources">Computing resources</h4>
<p>Much of our work uses sophisticated computational techniques, and we have a suite of powerful servers for this purpose. More often than not, if you are working on a computational task, it is easier to do it on one of our servers, or all of them in a cluster configuration. (You'll need a specific account to use these machines.)</p>
<h2 id="general-policies">General Policies</h2>
<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>
<p>In my experience, one of the strongest predictors of whether people will do well in the lab is their ability to communicate effectively, both with me and with others. Often there are two key barriers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes people worry that if they communicate questions or struggles, they will be seen as somehow inferior for not knowing something. In fact, that's rarely the case, and the opposite is a much bigger concern! People who don't communicate often get hung up on specific issues (that may be very challenging, and could really use outside perspective/discussion). Ultimately this leads to someone being much less productive than the person who's willing to ask questions. On the other hand, I've never once worried about somebody not knowing something - everyone in the lab is around because we believe in their talents. So the right decision is most often to just speak up! Try to overcome <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/How-to-Overcome-Impostor/244700">your imposter syndrome</a>, and focus on working with your colleagues (me, other lab members) to find a solution to the problem.</li>
<li>A second issue is that we're often afraid of "bothering" more senior people (undergrads worry about bothering grad students, grad students worry about bothering postdocs, everybody worries about bothering the PI, etc). I feel the same way about potentially bothering my own mentors and supervisors! Fight that instinct. Bottom line - I much prefer that people in the lab speak up, and I have no problem telling people if they are in fact bothering me (so far, this has never happened).</li>
</ul>
<p>If these are sources of anxiety, I totally get it. However, if it's possible to overcome them, your time in lab will end up being much easier, and likely your productivity will increase quite a bit!</p>
<p>As a bare minimum, I expect graduate and postdoctoral researchers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meet 1:1 every week to discuss ongoing activities, and set the meeting agenda and follow-up with action items (see below). If for some reason we can't meet (one of us is out of town or extraordinarily busy), post a weekly summary and plans for the upcoming week.</li>
<li>Post ongoing progress/results in a relevant Slack channel (good for chat, not great for long-term tracking) or on Basecamp (great for being able to come back to later)</li>
<li>Keep me updated when things aren't going to plan (examples: things are taking longer than anticipated, something is more complex than we thought, results don't match expectations, or something that seemed clear when we talked doesn't seem clear anymore). This stuff happens all the time, but updates are critical for helping set expectations and guiding decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note this is a minimum, and <em>I prefer more communication to less</em>. At another extreme, some people will send a 2-3 line update in the morning outlining their high-level goals/plans and checking in. This is a really good strategy and never bothers me, even if I don't have time to respond. Often, this process will reveal areas where we aren't on the same page, and prevent larger misunderstandings. So if this works for you, awesome. I certainly recognize that everyone has different communication styles.</p>
<p>I <em>do not</em> expect you to generally feel the need to respond to things on weekends or after hours. I do sometimes send emails or Slack messages during those times - that's just because I get to stuff when I get to it. Don't feel pressured to respond until you're back to work yourself! I only expect you to be responsive after hours during specific critical time periods (e.g., right before a submission deadline or leading up to a conference presentation). We should be able to anticipate those cases and agree upon a strategy in advance. If there's anything distressing about off-hours messages, just let me know, and I'll try not to bother you during those times.</p>
<h3 id="hours">Hours</h3>
<p>You benefit a lot from being in lab: it's a good way to learn from others, build camaraderie amongst team members, and avoid falling into distractions that you might face at home or elsewhere. Academia generally offers more flexibility than many other jobs, but full-time researchers should still be working on research 40 hrs/week. Early graduate students will have classes and TA'ing that cut into these hours, of course, but I expect you to show up to the lab regularly when you don't have those obligations.</p>
<p>To facilitate interaction, I encourage everyone to try to consistently be in lab between the hours of 10:30a to 4p. Some people like to work early, others late, but having a minimum window ensures there's a time where people can count on interacting with each other.</p>
<p>There's no concept of "face time" in the lab - I care much more that you're able to make consistent progress. But keep in mind that everyone benefits from a vibrant, interacting team.</p>
<p>Since a lot of the work we do involve setting up computational jobs that may run for several hours, it is often in your best interest to be able to login after hours, check the status on a run, make decisions about the next run, and get it going. Small, easy interventions in off hours can often save you hours or even days in a given week.</p>
<p><strong>Undergrads</strong> should work at least 10 hours/week in the lab. This is because we devote a massive amount of time (between grad students, postdocs, and myself) to training and mentoring undergrad lab members. Anything less than 10 hrs/week makes it impossible to make consistent progress, and thus isn't fair to the grad students/postdocs that take on mentorship roles. As mentioned above, all undergrads should setup a weekly schedule in the lab calendar so your mentors/colleagues can know when to expect you in the lab, and keep us posted when you need to deviate from that schedule. Occasionally it's possible to commit to fewer hours, if students have been working for a few semesters and are looking to transition away from the lab but hoping to finish up some work - talk to me about this.</p>
<h3 id="office-hours">Office hours</h3>
<p>If I'm in my office, my door is generally open and you're welcome to knock and come in. Sometimes I won't have time to talk and I'll let you know. If the door's closed, I might be on a call or trying to focus on something - in those cases, Slack is an easier way to see if I'm available.</p>
<h3 id="meetings">Meetings</h3>
<h4 id="one-on-one-meetings">One-on-one meetings</h4>
<p>As a graduate student or postdoc, I expect we will have structured meetings once/week. (We might miss one on occasion if I am out of town or etc.) These structured meetings are critical to tracking both high-level and low-level progress on your projects, and ultimately your career. </p>
<p>I leave the content of the meeting largely to your discretion. Sometimes it's helpful to discuss things that aren't specific to a project - classes, applications / rec letters, mental health, etc. This is how we make sure you have the time to discuss whatever you need to.</p>
<p>I expect you post a meeting agenda to your Slack meetings channel the night before we meet. This is because:</p>
<ul>
<li>You generally know the details of your efforts and any hangups much better than I do</li>
<li>You should be thinking about the high-level direction of your projects</li>
<li>If we don't start out with a plan for the meeting, we will likely spend all our time on one or a few issues, and miss critical pieces</li>
<li>If I don't get to review an agenda beforehand, then we'll likely waste time in person, or I'll miss the opportunity to knock out easy things prior to our meeting that will help you move faster.</li>
</ul>
<p>After our meeting, I expect you to post some notes on our discussion, as well as next steps / action items (for both of us), which we'll generally aim to complete prior to our next meeting.</p>
<p>We will of course generally have lots of opportunities for less formal interaction in the lab, but the weekly meeting is a key check-in to ensure you have time to address critical issues.</p>
<h4 id="lab-meetings">Lab Meetings</h4>
<p>We try to have lab meetings ~once/week, for ~1.5 hrs each. Content varies, but we typically cycle through journal clubbing papers of interest, lab members updating the group on their progress, and practicing presentations. It's also wonderful when people discover new things they think the rest of the lab might benefit from (technical tools, data visualization tips, version control strategies, project management approaches... anything heplful) - if you have something like this to share, let me know and we can easily carve out 5-10 minutes in the meeting to discuss.</p>
<p>I expect grad students and postdocs to present ~twice/semester. I strongly encourage undergrads to present project updates as well - it's great practice!</p>
<p>We typically adjust our lab meeting schedule every semester to accommodate people's classes as best as we can. Lab members are expected to attend all meetings, but of course it's understandable when things come up.</p>
<h3 id="deadlines">Deadlines</h3>
<p>If you have something with a deadline, you want to bring it up with your collaborators as soon as you find out what the deadline is. Don't be afraid to bug people - far, far worse is putting something off until the last minute, and forcing your collaborators to scramble.</p>
<p>If you need something incidental from me (paperwork, etc.), I'd appreciate a week's notice to be sure get it back to you.</p>
<p>If you need something more substantial from me (feedback on an abstract, a letter of recommendation) I need at least two weeks to make this happen.</p>
<p>For things that will need multiple back-and-forth interactions (fellowship applications, paper drafts, research statements), I need as much time as you can give me, and you'll need a significant amount of time to integrate any substantive feedback. A 3 week lead time is the minimum here. If you haven't head from me on something in two weeks, ping me about it again. I am rarely bothered or annoyed when someone checks in to make sure I'm on top of something. And in any case, it's much better than having something slip by - so don't worry about bothering me.</p>
<h3 id="presentations">Presentations</h3>
<p>Communicating research is a critical piece of the research endeavor - if we don't communicate our work, it may as well have never happened! So learning to deliver compelling presentations is an important piece of your training (and good presentation skills are invaluable even outside of academia).</p>
<p>When you present your work, you are representing not only yourself, but also your lab. So I highly encourage every student to get as much practice presenting as possible, whether it's within our lab meetings, journal clubs, events with other labs on campus, and external presentations/events.</p>
<p>If you're planning to give an external presentation, I generally expect you to give a practice presentation in lab at least 2 weeks ahead of time (1 week emergency situations, but that is really not enough time to integrate feedback and practice your revised presentation). If you're planning on giving a job talk, I'd recommend you give practice presentations at least a month ahead of time, because getting that right is an iterative process.</p>
<p>We keep copies of previous presentations in the lab Google Drive. I highly encourage our team to share presentation materials (you're welcome to anything from my own presentations). Check with other folks before using their materials.</p>
<h3 id="recommendation-letters">Recommendation Letters</h3>
<h3 id="purchasing">Purchasing</h3>
<p>Generally if you need to buy something that's less than ~$50, I prefer you order it to move quickly, and then just drop me a line to let me know you did. If something's more expensive, let me know and I'll get back to you soon. It is important to me that progress isn't stalled because we're waiting for parts or etc. In general, your time is the most valuable commodity in the lab.</p>
<p>We have multiple avenues for purchasing items (Emory Express for many vendors, Amazon, Newegg). Generally grad students and postdocs have access to our corporate card for purchasing from external vendors, or work with our admin (Colleen Spellen). If you purchase anything on our corporate card, it is critical to send the receipt to Colleen as soon as you have it.</p>
<h3 id="grant-funding">Grant Funding</h3>
<p>Our funding comes from various sources - Chethan's startup package, grants from the NSF, NIH, DARPA, and private foundations. I will often ask you for help with grants, especially preparing figures, reviewing text, helping brainstorm, etc. When this happens, it's usually on a tight deadline - sorry in advance.</p>
<p>I keep copies of many (successful and failed) submissions on our lab's Google Drive share. These are confidential and only for internal lab use. I'd encourage you to read through some of them to understand the funding process, to see how often I fail at stuff too, and to get a sense of our lab's long-term vision. Feel free to discuss any of this with me.</p></div>
