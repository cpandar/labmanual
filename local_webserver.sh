# this just uses mkdocs to start a local webserver with this content.
# mkdocs must be installed already
# on my personal laptop (OS X), which has homebrew installed, this was done via:
#     brew install mkdocs

# make sure you're in this directory.

# start the webserver:
mkdocs serve

# page should appear as
