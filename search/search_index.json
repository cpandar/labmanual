This is the Lab manual for the Systems Neural Engineering Lab at Emory University and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Our research is in the area of systems neuroscience and neuroengineering, and we're part of the GT/Emory Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering, the Emory Department of Neurosurgery, and the Emory Neuromodulation Technology Innovation Center (ENTICe). If you've just joined the lab - welcome! We're excited to have you as part of the team. We try to be a welcoming group. You'll find the lab filled with smart, passionate people with broad interests at the intersection of neuroscience, engineering, and computational sciences. We really value diversity and openness in this lab, and hope to make it a friendly and productive environment. If you are officially joining, you need to read this manual through, then sign this form saying you've done so (and send to me via email). Acknowledgement Our lab manual borrows heavily from this one . I was inspired to put it together after reading Mariam Aly's great article , and via thoughtful discussions as part of the GT/Emory BME Dept 's Committee on Diversity and Inclusion. The lab manual is definitely a work in progress. If you have ideas about things to add, or what to clarify, talk to me (Chethan, the PI) or the lab manager.

If you\u2019re a PI or a trainee in a different lab and want to write your own lab manual, feel free to take inspiration from this one (and cite it!). General Philosophy The mission of our lab is to produce work that truly advances the fields of neuroengineering and neuroscience, develops novel strategies and devices to treat disorders of the nervous system, expands our knowledge of the brain, and never compromises in quality and scientific integrity. Every lab has a different style. In our lab, we benefit greatly from our diverse team, bringing in expertise from a wide variety of disciplines (e.g., Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Neuroscience, Biomedical Engineering, Physiology, Physics). No one in the lab (including myself) has the expertise necessary to tackle all the problems we're trying to solve. The only way we can be successful is by fostering an openly collaborative and communicative environment. Our lab definitely selects for people who are comfortable admitting they don't know something and learning new material as they go (both through independent research and discussion with colleagues). Technical skills are important, but equally (if not more important) are communication skills. Internally, we want to be in a place where everyone in the lab is comfortable giving and receiving direct, constructive criticism and feedback. One of the hardest things to do is to open up your thoughts and ideas to criticism, for fear that people will judge you personally. Expectations and Responsibilities Everyone Principal Investigator As a PI, I expect my lab members to be driven, focused, and passionate about their work. My goal as a mentor is to ensure that my trainees are working on projects that align with their long-term goals and interests. I will, to the best of my ability, strive to keep roadblocks out of their way so they can focus on producing the highest quality research possible. Above all, my goal is to create an openly collaborative research environment where the research team is happy and productive.
